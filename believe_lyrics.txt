No matter how hard I try 
You keep pushing me aside 
And I can't break through 
There's no talkin' to you 
It's so sad that you're leavin' 
It takes time to believe it 

But after all is said and done 

You're gonna be the lonely one...ohhh 



Do you believe in life after love? 

I can feel something inside me say 

I really don't think you're strong enough, no 

Do you believe in life after love? 

I can feel something inside me say, 

I really don't think you're strong enough, no 



What am I supposed to do, 

Sit around and wait for you 

Well I can't do that 

And there's no turnin' back 

I need time to move on 

I need love to feel strong 

'Cos I've had time to think it through 

,N' maybe I'm too good for you, ohhh

I really don't think you're strong enough, no 

Do you believe in life after love?

I really don't think you're strong enough, no 

Well I know that I'll get through this 

'Cos I know that I am strong 

And, I don't need you anymore 

I don't need you anymore 

I don't need you anymore 

No, I don't need you anymore
