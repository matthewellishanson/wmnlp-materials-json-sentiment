Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda
Janky stash box when the federals roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches in trouble
I hope the universe love you today

'cause the energy we bringing sure to carry away a flock of positive activist a filthy body would hate

If it's necessary

Bumping jeezy first album looking distracted

Speaking language only we know, you think is an accent

The windows roll down all I see is a hand pass it

Hotboxing like george foreman grilling the masses

Of the working world, we pulled up on a bunch of working girls

And asked them what they working with - look at me

I got the blunt in my mouth

Usually I'm drug-free, but shit I'm with the homies



(yea nigga, we off a pill and remy red

Come through and bust ya head nigga)

Me and the homies

(sag all the way to the liquor store

Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more)

Me and the homies

(i ride for my mothafuckin' niggas

Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in)

Me and the homies

(matter fact, I hop out that mothafucka and be like

"doo! doo! doo! doo!...doo! doo! doo! doo! doo!")



It's 2:30 and the sun is beaming

Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screaming

Hungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me

I'll tell you to suck my dick and then I'll continue eating

We speeding on the 405 passing westchester

You know the light skin girls in all the little dresses, good lord

They knew we weren't from 'round there

'cause every time we down there we pulling out the boost mobile sim cards

Bougie bitches with no extensions

Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination

Before we sparked a conversation

We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like then started interrogating

I never was a gangbanger, I mean I was never stranger to the funk neither

I really doubt it

Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it

That's ironic 'cause I've never been violent, until I'm with the homies



(just ridin', just ridin')

Me and the homies

(bullshittin', actin' a fool)

Me and the homies

(trippin', really trippin')

Me and the homies

(just ridin', just ridin', just ridin'...)



Bragging 'bout the episode we just had

A shot of hennessey didn't make me feel that bad

I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma

Consequences from evil will make your past haunt you

We tryna conquer the city with disobedience

Quick to turn it up, beefing if we ain't got the cd in

But jeezy still playing and our attitude is still "nigga, what is you saying"

Pull in front of the house that we been camping out for like two months

The sun is going down as we take whatever we want

I hit the back window in search of any nintendo

Dvds, plasma screen tvs in the trunk

We made a right, then made a left made a right

Then made a left, we was just circling life

My mama called - "kicking it"

I should've told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense with the homies



But they made a right, they made a left then made a right

Then another right

One lucky night with the homies



(and this is the art of peer pressure, this is the art of peer pressure)

Me and the homies

(this is the art of peer pressure, this is the art of peer pressure)

Me and the homies

(and this is the art of peer pressure, this is the art of peer pressure)

Me and the homies

(this is the art of peer pressure, this is the art of peer pressure)
