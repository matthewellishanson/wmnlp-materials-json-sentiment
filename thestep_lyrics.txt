So baby, when I'm near you
You can't feel me, I'm lightnin'
You used to come by
And sit down by my side
You would come in close
And take off all my clothes



Every time I think that I've been takin' the steps

You end up mad at me for makin' a mess

I can't understand, why you don't understand me

Baby

And every day I wake up and I make money for myself

And though we share a bed, you know that I don't need your help

Do you understand?

You don't understand me

Baby



All the ivy

Is growing sideways

You won't stop it

'Till it covers all my place



Every time I think that I've been takin' the steps

You end up mad at me for makin' a mess

I can't understand, why you don't understand me

Baby

And every day I wake up and make money for myself

And though we share a bed, you know that I don't need your help

Do you understand?

You don't understand me

Baby



If I go right

And you go left

Hey, I know we'll meet up again

And if you go left

And I go right

Hey, maybe that's just life sometimes



Every time I think that I've been takin' the steps

You end up mad at me for makin' a mess

I can't understand, why you don't understand me

Baby

And every day I wake up and make money for myself

And though we share a bed, you know that I don't need your help

Do you understand?

You don't understand me

Baby
